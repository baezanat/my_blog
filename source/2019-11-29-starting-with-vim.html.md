Are you thinking about trying VIM? I am a newbie to coding in general, and I've only been using VIM for about 3 weeks, but I already love it. If you're looking for some editing wizardry and want some tips to get started, please read on.

## 1. Why VIM  

There are good reasons both to try VIM and to stick to other editors. Here are the reasons that brought me to VIM:  

1. Popular editors come in and out of existence fairly often, unable to survive big technology shifts. These changes are disruptive; you have to learn to use a new text editor and build muscle memory with it. VIM/ VI has been around for about 40 years and has withstood all kinds of major changes, so could actually be a text editor for life.
2. It takes time to learn VIM, but it is clear from seeing VIM wizards use VIM that you can get to a very high level of proficiency with it. I like the prospect of reaching mastery with my tools.  
3. You can configure VIM to your needs with a very high level of precision.
4. I'm just a sucker for new, hard things to learn.

## 2. Tips to Get Started  

The first thing you need is to learn the basic commands to get around VIM. The <a class="link" href="https://www.openvim.com/">VIM TUTOR</a> is a good place to start.

After that, you need to practice on your own.   
- Make a simple practice text file and play around with it. Practic makes perfect.  

- I recommend keeping a file with the most useful commands you've found. As you find new things you need and figure out how to do them with VIM, you'll expand your list into a very useful cheat sheet.

I got some great ideas to configure VIM for my needs from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/vim-training-course-ruby-developers/learn/lecture/6174330?start=135#overview" class="link">this udemy course</a> for Ruby developers, since my current work is mostly with Ruby. If you'd like to follow a structured course, <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/vim-commands-cheat-sheet/">this</a> looks like a good general introduction, and it's only $10. In general though, you'll learn the most from simply using vim as much as you can and solving problems as they arise. You can find great resources at <a href:"www.vim.org" class="link">vim online</a>. Usually, though, I just google search what I need and always find a solution.
