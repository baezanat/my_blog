title: Five Mistakes to Avoid When Learning to Code from Scratch

My academic background is in philosophy and I have worked as a translator, editorial assistant and university instructor. Until 6 months ago, I had never opened a terminal or even gotten a computer to print "Hello World". I was happy enough to use computers as nifty magic boxes.  

That was, until a friend who knew I had been looking for something new to do for a while insisted that I should try coding. One morning when I didn't have anything pressing to do, I thought, why not, and checked out codecademy. By the end of the day I was enrolled in their computer science pro track. By the end of the month I was enrolled in their web development pro track. Now I am fully embarked on a coding journey and I'm loving it.  

But I've had lots of ups and downs, so here I'll try to summarize the 5 biggest things I wish I had avoided as I started this new path.

## 1. Narrow things down as quickly as possible and stick with your choice.  

As I already mentioned, I started with codecademy's computer science track, which works with python. About three weeks into the track (and about 40% of the way through it), an acquaintance who is a senior developer told me that I really should focus on front-end stuff first because it would be a better way to learn things and to land a job. So I started codecademy's web development track. I thought I might do both tracks in parallel or explore the front-end track and then go back to the other, but the topics are too different and I need to stay focused on one thing to learn, so I basically dropped the computer science track and focused on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And I sort of forgot most of the early work on python...

## 2. Code every day, or almost every day, no matter what.  

I started learning in May. My kids' schools were out for summer holidays in June, and they started school again in late September. (The school calendar in Italy is insane!) Anyway, I tried at first to keep my work up but it proved impossible with small kids. I thought, no problem, I'll pick back up where I left off in the fall... Except not. Coding ability is built on muscle memory, hand-muscle memory, brain-muscle memory. Without practice, it just recedes without much of a trail.

## 3. Take notes! 

Now I always take notes, but I so wish I had done it from the start. When I picked back up in September, there were a lot of details I did not remember. And there were no notes to go back to in order to refresh my memory. I just had to sort of start again.

## 4. Follow a structured curriculum.  

This is not for everyone, but it's proven to be absolutely necessary for me. There's just too much to learn, and without a guide through the forest I keep getting lost in rabbit holes. When I picked back up in September, I decided to start a coding bootcamp. After doing some research, I zeroed in on Launch School, which prides itself as offering "a slow path for studious beginners". It's not nearly as fast as the 9 or 12-week bootcamps out there, and it's self-paced, but I really like that it uses mastery-based learning and focuses on software engineering foundations rather than higher-level frameworks. Following the Launch School program has enabled me to spend less time wondering what to learn next and getting lost into rabbit holes, and it has also given me a community to learn with.

## 5. Stay focused.  

I have to repeat this to myself all the time, and I still stray away sometimes. There's just too much exciting stuff to learn in the world of coding. Just to give an example, the Launch School program I'm in uses Ruby for the back-end portion of the curriculum. They recently announced that they are launching a paralled core curriculum program that follows the same principles but uses JavaScript. I've been extremely tempted to switch tracks and start again, especially because the JavaScript track is actually 2 courses shorter than the Ruby track (the latter also involves learning JavaScript for the front-end portion of the program). However, if I've learned anything so far is that I have to stay focused and stick with what I've started. There will always be shiny new options on the radar, but following them would entail never sticking with anything enough to finish.  
Another example of this is my experience with VIM. I started out using sublime, and I was happy enough with it, but someone mentioned VIM... and I couldn't resist! That cost me about a week of work, and I'm still not as productive in VIM as I was in sublime. Will it turn out to be worth it in the end? More on that in my next post. Stay tuned!
